# Quadcopter

This repository contains my results of the project "Teach a quadcopter how to fly", being part of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree at Udacity. The task was to design an agent that is able to fly a quadcopter in a continous space environment, training it with a reinforcement learning algorithm.

## Project Details 

### Please post details here
Coming soon...


Hereby the action space is limited to providing thrust to the four motors of the quadcopter.
